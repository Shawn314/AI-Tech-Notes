📘 **Technical Notes · Translations · LLM Engineering**

This is a personal repository for long-term technical accumulation. It includes article translations, original insights, hands-on experiments, and study notes — primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), AI systems, and applied machine learning.

The goal is to organize knowledge systematically, share learnings, and build a foundation for long-term growth and influence.
